                    <span itemprop="description"><p>Tracing apps, emergency ordinances, more police on the streets to enforce the
rules. Tackling the Corona crisis has a major impact on daily life and our
freedom of movement. It makes the government proud that we abide by the rules
en masse, but as in every crisis there is also a different sound. How great is
the tension between tackling the crisis and our freedom? How self-evident is
it that we will regain our freedoms when this emergency is over? We went
looking for that different sound in our province, for people who each in their
own way stand up for freedom. Dr. Matthijs Pontier (35) is an AI scientist
(VU-Amsterdam) and activist. He has been <strong>active for the Pirate Party for
many years and was previously a list leader in the European elections</strong>.
Personal freedom and the right to self-determination, both in the physical and
the digital world, are his main motives. "The choices we make now determine
what kind of world we wake up in." Pontier argues for more confidence in
society. It is the government's task to inform and facilitate, not to control
us. He sees an area of tension between the fight against the Coronavirus and
our democratic rights and freedoms. <strong>Shortsightedness</strong> Almost all advice is
based on the policy of the Outbreak Management Team (OMT). The data and models
have not been made public. Nor are the considerations made within the OMT -
only the advice itself. It is therefore not clear how the advice is arrived
at. Nevertheless, the Cabinet seems to be blind to this. We are currently
governed by a very small club and then you run the risk of a narrowing of
vision. The government is deploying various measures to control the crisis,
measures that until recently seemed unthinkable. For fear of Corona, the
population accepts without protest that the government is claiming powers that
we would normally protect with all our might. "If we surrender a lot of
fundamental rights now, you wake up in a much less free world than before the
Corona crisis. You saw that happening after 9/11. A lot of surveillance
measures were put in place, which were never reversed after that. In a
situation like this, there is always a risk that this will happen. That's what
I want to warn people about."
[embed]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV4g7CGXvow[/embed">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV4g7CGXvow[/embed</a>] <strong>Contact tracing
apps</strong> The Cabinet now wants to use contact tracing apps to check whether
someone has been in the vicinity of an infected person and to estimate whether
someone has been infected on the basis of symptoms. Such apps are already
being used in various countries. Often developed by companies that once did
business with the secret services. In China and Israel there is totalitarian
surveillance. Citizens are monitored every step of the way. "I find it
frightening that the government can keep an eye on me all the time. My fear is
that this will continue after the crisis. That's where it seems to be going
now. That kind of data is also used to manipulate our behaviour. Apple and
Google even want to build this into their operating system." The app creates a
log of users who have been in the vicinity of infected persons. Users can then
share the log with the authorities. And that's where the shoe pinches, because
apart from the care personnel, hardly anyone is tested for the virus. The use
of Bluetooth also makes the app very unreliable, says Pontier. "It's always a
few metres off, even under ideal circumstances. What we can do better is to
trace infections through human professionals. For example, you can keep a
diary yourself or be interviewed by a trained person who can then map that
out. That works much better."</p>
<blockquote><p>"I don't have much confidence that the Minister and his team are going to be
okay now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I do have some technical knowledge and that was especially important when
judging those apps. That I can assess that fairly well. I'm concerned with the
ethics of technology in general. With my technical knowledge, I know what
conditions must always be imposed on technology. In any case, the apps that
have been tested so far did not meet those conditions. In addition, the
government does not have such a good track record of technological solutions.
So I also have little confidence that Hugo de Jonge and his team will do well
now". <strong>Mass testing</strong> In order to control Corona, it seems especially
important to test en masse, so that the number of infections can be properly
mapped out. By temporarily isolating infected people, vulnerable people are
better protected, as for example in Germany. There the mortality rate is
considerably lower than in other countries, including the Netherlands. Pontier
believes that a democratic society should be based on free choices that people
make themselves "By providing good information, but also give citizens the
right not to work if you do not have a safe workplace and the right to keep
children at home if they have a vulnerable person in the family, and it is
unsafe to send their child to school". Especially with the mouth caps, things
are going completely wrong according to Pontier. "You have to enable people to
protect themselves and others. The availability is great and we've been
working on it for a long time, it's not a man on the moon project. The Dutch
even advise against wearing mouthpieces, while the advice of the comparable
Institutes - in Belgium and Germany is to wear mouthpieces. All studies show
that homemade mouthpieces don't stop everything, but it's certainly better
than nothing. If 60% of the population wears them, then that virus will die
out much faster". <strong>Wrong starting point</strong> It is difficult to find out why
these opinions differ so much, because the considerations of the OMT are not
public. "They're actually saying we're too stupid to understand. That's
basically what it comes down to, and that's weird. Then you're actually
lacking in confidence that we could make wise choices ourselves. Which, in my
opinion, should be the starting point. You see, we do: After the advice came
not to shake hands, 99 percent stuck to it. People really do want to take care
of themselves, but as a government you have to give the trust, and then you
get that trust back. Then people are going to stick to those measures."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Eventually this Corona crisis will blow over again, but now it's very
important to stay alert."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He absolutely does not agree with experts who say that society will degenerate
into chaos if no measures are imposed. "A very large group of young people,
who are not really at risk, lock themselves up out of solidarity and generally
abide very well by the rules. I advocate giving people more responsibility
based on their own role. Be more open about how these choices are made, so
that we don't get caught up in a tunnel vision. By giving people more insight
into the decisions that are made, you also create more confidence and people
will comply more quickly with the measures that are taken". <strong>Fighting
spirit</strong> Despite his fighting spirit, it is difficult to draw attention to
this subject and to link concrete actions to it. "Our right to demonstrate is
also being stripped down quite a bit at the moment. In any case, we are very
active online. On Twitter, for example, I'm very busy with it and sometimes I
ask open questions because, yes, I don't have all the answers either. We don't
know what the best solution is because there's no access to that information.
I think it's good to discuss this with each other and also ask critical
questions. So that the government and the OMT just don’t get into that tunnel
vision and make the wrong choices. Ultimately, the Corona crisis will blow
over again, but it is now very important to remain alert"</p>

                    <span itemprop="description"><p>Brussels, 15/5/2020 - <strong>Y</strong> <strong>esterday</strong> <strong>, in plenary, the</strong> <strong>European
Parliament</strong> <strong>endorsed a number of budgetary</strong> <strong>discharge report</strong> <strong>s,</strong>
<strong>which include</strong> <strong>Pirate amendment</strong> <strong>s</strong> <strong>**</strong>urging EU institutions to<strong></strong>predominantly<strong> </strong>use<strong> </strong>Open Source<strong> </strong>solutions<strong> </strong>.<strong> </strong>This success
happened d<strong> </strong>espite the joint effort of the<strong> </strong>EPP and ECR<strong> </strong>Groups to
strike out these essential parts of the reports<strong> </strong>. I<strong> </strong>n<strong> </strong>practic<strong></strong>e,<strong> </strong>from now on,<strong> </strong>all<strong> </strong>IT solution<strong> </strong>s<strong> <em>**</em></strong>developed by<strong>
<em>**</em></strong>and for<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>EU institutions<strong> </strong>will<strong> <em>**</em></strong>first<strong> </strong>need<strong>
<em>**</em></strong>to be<strong> <em>**</em></strong>asses<strong> </strong>sed against<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>possibility of<strong></strong>using<strong> </strong>Open Source solution<strong> </strong>s. A<strong> </strong>ssessments will<strong> </strong>then<strong></strong>have to be reported<strong> </strong>back to the Budgetary Control Committee of the
Parliament on an<strong> </strong>annual<strong> </strong>basis, during<strong> </strong>the discharge procedure.
This<strong> </strong>is a strong call for enhancing<strong> </strong>our important citizens right to
transparent and trustworthy information<strong> </strong>.** <em>"</em> <em>It's</em> <em>__a milestone for
transparent and open digitization of the European institutions. From now on,
the Open Source ecosystem has a stepping ground for offering Open Source
solutions and the Pirates will gladly play the role of the</em> <em>guardians</em> <em>and
will try to solve and highlight any attempt to bypass this strong
recommendation. It’s a really important step to remove vendor lock-ins in the
Parliament“</em> , says Pirate Vice-President of European Parliament Marcel
Kolaja. <em>"Open Source Software improves transparency and trust from citizens,
as information is published in open and machine-readable formats, so that
everyone can access, comment and re-use it to drive value. It also provides
access to the source code, which enab</em> <em>les public participation and scrutiny
of the presentation and analysis methods,“</em> comments Pirate MEP Mikuláš Peksa.
It is essential for the European institutions to retain control over its own
technical systems, especially in a context of disinformation and foreign
interference. Open Source promotes local technical support, leads to rapid
development of software and helps to avoid dependency on specific suppliers or
vendor lock-in effects, which exist when only one company is in charge of
software or even the entire IT infrastructure supply. Open Source Software
also has potential for security improvements because it permits the
identification and the fixing of weaknesses in a transparent and collaborative
manner, while making it more difficult for hackers to introduce malware in the
system. Finally, publicly financed software developed for the public sector
should be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software
licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well. Free and
Open Source Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share, and
improve software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like
freedom of speech, press, and privacy. Full text of the Free and Open Source
Software related parts of the European Parliament discharge report 2018:  §48
|  |  |  |  | Recognises that the production of public data under open,
machine-readable format, easily accessible and re-usable, offers great
opportunities both for transparency towards the public and innovation;
welcomes the current initiatives to create and convert part of its data that
are of interest to the public under that format; underlines the need to have a
more user-friendly, systematic and coordinated approach for such initiatives,
under a well-defined Parliament open data policy;<br>
---|---|---|---|---|---<br>
§49 |  |  |  |  | Recognises the added value that free and open source
software can bring to Parliament; underlines in particular their role in
increasing transparency and avoiding vendor lock-in effects; recognises also
their potential for security improvements as they permit to identify and fix
the weaknesses; strongly recommends any software developed for the institution
to be made publicly available under free and open-source software licence;<br>
§50 |  |  |  |  | Notes that the results of roll-call votes in plenary should
be available in an open, machine-readable format and easily visible on
Parliament’s website; calls on Parliament therefore to publish the machine-
readable version of the roll-call vote results next to the non-machine-
readable versions, on the plenary minutes’ webpage;<br>
§79 |  |  |  |  | and further encourages the use of free open-sources self-
hosted social network platforms having special regards to users’ data
protection;</p>

supports today's call by 44 civil society organisations on EU bodies and EU
Member States to ban biometric mass surveillance: "Just like China and Russia,
some EU Member States such as France are exploring the use of facial
recognition and behavioral detection technology to control public spaces. I
don't want to live with technology that permanently matches my face in public
or reports 'unusual behaviour'. Such mass surveillance has a massive chilling
effect on society, results in false incrimination and discriminates certain
groups of people such as people of colour or elderly. Now is the time for the
Commission to live up to its promises on ethical AI and propose a ban on
biometric mass surveillance!" The Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament
advocates an EU moratorium on the use of facial recognition and behavioral
detection technology for mass surveillance of public spaces. Link to today's
