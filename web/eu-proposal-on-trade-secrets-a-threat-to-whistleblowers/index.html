Papers – we saw trade secret laws abused as a shield
against investigation and exposure of how corporations are harming the public
good, avoiding taxes and endangering public safety. Whistleblowers find
themsielves fighting for their freedom in court – or in hiding. And yet, the
European Parliament is about to expand corporate secrecy and deter
whistleblowing by adopting the Trade Secrets Directive.
Lex Wikileaks
Just as Wikileaks made headlines, the EU began toughening trade secrets
laws, endangering whistleblowers __Tweet
this!

According to research conducted by Austrian investigative journalist Erich
Moechel, preparations for the Directive
coincided with Wikileaks revelations first making international headlines.
He points out the discrepancy between the European Parliament’s decision to
award LuxLeaks whistleblower Antoine Deltour with the European Citizen’s Prize
2015, after his revelations led to recovering several hundred million euro of
tax revenue, while at the same time preparing to pass a law that will make the
kind of &lt;a href=&#34;https://support-
antoine.org/en/&#34;&gt;prosecution that Antoine Deltour now faces for trade secrets disclosure in Luxembourg a norm across
Europe. The Greens/EFA, my political group in the European Parliament, will
reject the Directive
in the plenary vote on Thursday April 14th , echoing the concerns by over
half a million petition signatories across Europe as well as civil society
organisations including the Confederation of German Trade Unions, Corporate
Europe Observatory, Syndicat National des Journalistes and Whistleblower
Netzwerk e.V. &lt;a href=&#34;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ts-

delay2-280x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;We proposed delaying the vote until the Directive can be paired
with a Whistleblower Protection Directive , a draft for which our group
will present on May 4. In rejecting this proposal, the EPP and S&amp;amp;D groups are
deciding to press on to broaden companies’ abilities to keep important
information away from the public eye and deter leaks while the Panama Papers
continue to be front-page news.   *
Effects of adopting the Directive
1. A right to hide wrongdoing
In many member states, the Trade Secrets Directive will broadly expand the
definition of what kind of information may be protected. The new definition
(Article 2) does not exclude e.g. information about illegal or harmful
activities or pending investigations into such. It provides a floor, but not
a ceiling for trade secret protection in the EU: Member states may have even
further-reaching criminal law provisions. Existing criminal provisions are
bound to be updated to cover the new broad definition, whereas the Directive’s
exceptions will not automatically apply to them" />

Papers</a> – we saw <strong>trade secret laws abused</strong> as a shield
against investigation and exposure of how corporations are harming the public
good, avoiding taxes and endangering public safety. Whistleblowers find
themsielves fighting for their freedom in court – or in hiding. And yet, <strong>the
European Parliament is about to expand corporate secrecy and deter
whistleblowing by adopting the Trade Secrets Directive.</strong></p>
<h3>Lex Wikileaks</h3>
<blockquote><p>Just as Wikileaks made headlines, the EU began toughening trade secrets
laws, endangering whistleblowers<a href="https://juliareda.eu/2016/04/trade-secrets-whistleblowers/#"> __Tweet
this!</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1769150/">research conducted by Austrian investigative journalist Erich
Moechel,</a> preparations for the Directive
<strong>coincided with Wikileaks revelations</strong> first making international headlines.
He points out the discrepancy between the European Parliament’s decision to
award LuxLeaks whistleblower Antoine Deltour with the European Citizen’s Prize
2015, after his revelations led to recovering several hundred million euro of
tax revenue, while at the same time preparing to pass a law that will make the
kind of <a href="https://support-
antoine.org/en/">prosecution that Antoine Deltour now faces</a> for trade secrets disclosure in Luxembourg a norm across
Europe. The Greens/EFA, my political group in the European Parliament, will
<a href="http://www.greens-efa.eu/trade-secrets-15101.html"><strong>reject</strong></a> the Directive
in the <strong>plenary vote on Thursday April 14th</strong> , echoing the concerns by over
half a million petition signatories across Europe as well as civil society
organisations including the Confederation of German Trade Unions, Corporate
Europe Observatory, Syndicat National des Journalistes and Whistleblower
Netzwerk e.V. <a href="https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ts-
delay2.png"><img src="https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ts-
delay2-280x300.png" alt=""></a>We proposed delaying the vote until the Directive can be paired
with a <strong>Whistleblower Protection Directive</strong> , a draft for which our group
will present on May 4. In rejecting this proposal, the EPP and S&amp;D groups are
deciding to press on to broaden companies’ abilities to keep important
information away from the public eye and deter leaks while the Panama Papers
continue to be front-page news. <em> </em> *</p>
<h2>Effects of adopting the Directive</h2>
<h3>1. A right to hide wrongdoing</h3>
<p>In many member states, the Trade Secrets Directive will <strong>broadly expand the
definition</strong> of what kind of information may be protected. The new definition
(Article 2) does not exclude e.g. information about illegal or harmful
activities or pending investigations into such. <strong>It provides a floor, but not
a ceiling</strong> for trade secret protection in the EU: Member states may have even
further-reaching criminal law provisions. Existing criminal provisions are
bound to be updated to cover the new broad definition, whereas the Directive’s
exceptions will not automatically apply to them</p>
</b>

         <p>.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Germany today requires companies to demonstrate a legitimate
interest in what they claim as trade secrets. Only business information can be
protected – ruling out protection i.e. for information about an ongoing
investigation. These essential limitations would be dropped.</p>
<h3>2. A chilling effect on whistleblowing</h3>
<blockquote><p>It appears that you have had unauthorised access to proprietary documents
and information taken from our company […] We trust that you are fully aware
that using information/documentation unlawfully obtained is a crime, and we
will not hesitate to pursue all available criminal and civil remedies. —
<a href="http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56fd26cfa1bb8d3c3495aba1/">Mossack Fonseca’s
response</a>
to the Panama Papers, 3 April 2016</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Directive will increase the ability of companies caught red-handed to
<strong>sue whistleblowers</strong> and investigative journalists. It places the <strong>burden
of proof</strong> of acting in the public interest on the whistleblower – and refers
to the “general public interest”, for which no common definition exists. It
does not preclude member states from <strong>making whistleblowers criminals.</strong> In
January 2015, the French government attempted to introduce laws threatening 3
years in jail and a fine of €375,000 for disclosing trade secrets in
anticipation of this Directive. While ultimately defeated, that attempt
foreshadows the increased rigor we can expect to see in other member states.
Given the massive power imbalance between whistleblowers (usually workers) and
corporations who can afford protracted legal battles, this is bound to cause a
significant <strong>chilling effect</strong> – even after the repeated demonstrations over
the last few months that society increasingly relies on insiders to expose
malpractice that evades national law enforcement and democratic oversight.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Edward Snowden’s revelations of massive global suspicionless
surveillance would likely not meet the criteria of the Directive’s
whistleblower exception.</p>
<h3>3. Threats to public safety and oversight</h3>
<p>Because the Directive makes no distinction based on the purpose for which
secret information is acquired, used or disclosed, it does not just protect
companies from corporate espionage, unfair competition etc., but also from
<strong>many legitimate needs to access unknown information.</strong> Some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dieselgate:</strong> The German safety testing organisation <em>TÜV</em> was unable to inspect car engine software for emissions testing defeat devices because car manufacturers <a href="http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article149147139/TUeV-erhebt-schwere-Vorwuerfe-gegen-Bundesregierung.html">claimed trade secrets protection.</a></li>
<li><strong>Deadly experiment:</strong> In a French drug trial this year, a man died. When scientists requested access to crucial data to find out what happened, the sponsoring company refused, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-question-design-of-fatal-french-clinical-trial-1.19221">claiming trade secret protection.</a></li>
<li><strong>Secret studies:</strong> The EU based its controversial assessment that the active ingredient of Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide (glyphosate) is “unlikely” to cause cancer – contradicting WHO findings – in part on industry-sponsored studies that are unavailable for examination by independent scientists <a href="http://corporateeurope.org/efsa/2016/02/key-evidence-withheld-trade-secret-eus-controversial-risk-assessment-glyphosate">due to trade secrets claims.</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Threats to workers’ rights and mobility</h3>
<p>In negotiations with the Council, an amendment was dropped that ensured
knowledge gained on the job can not be classified as a trade secret. This
exposes workers to the <strong>risk of being sued by their previous employer for 6
years</strong> after changing jobs. While the Directive does not itself introduce
sanctions against the disclosure of knowledge under these circumstances, it
leaves member states open to do so.</p>

suing former or existing employees (Source: Corporate Europe Observatory)</p>

<h2>Reactions</h2>
<blockquote><p>We ask the Members of European Parliament to vote against this directive. It
is suitable to <strong>restrict</strong> the possibilities of journalistic research,
<strong>intimidate</strong> journalists and hinder editorial work by high cost risks.

<p>They transformed a legislation which should have regulated fair competition
between companies into something resembling <strong>a blanket right to corporate
secrecy,</strong> which now threatens anyone in society who sometimes needs access to
companies’ internal information without their consent: consumers, employees,
journalists, scientists… —Corporate Europe Observatory, European Network of

secrets-protection">over 40 further NGOs</a></p>
<p>The proposal […] bears <strong>serious risk to consumers’ and workers’ interests,
to the environment and to human rights.</strong> The protection of whistleblowers –
the majority of them are workers – will be insufficient […]. It is also
disappointing that skills and expertise gained in the context of employment
relationships can potentially be declared trade secrets. —<a href="https://juliareda.eu/wp-

<p>[…] a lot of legal uncertainty still surrounds the circumstances in which
investigative journalists and their sources can be sued. Faced with the
prospect of having to pay compensatory damages, this uncertainty <strong>will lead
to journalists and their sources keeping valuable information to themselves</strong>.

<p>Adopting a text that creates a situation where secrecy is the legal norm for
companies’ internal information and transparency is the exception is clear
proof of the European Commission’s preference towards <strong>corporate interest
over public interest.</strong> —<a href="http://itcointergroup.eu/sample-

<p><strong>Thu April 7 —</strong> Greens/EFA co-president Philippe Lamberts requested to
postpone the vote until the Commission will have proposed and the European
Parliament and Council adopted a parallel text on the protection of
whistleblowers. The two would then be adopted as a package. The proposal was
rejected by EPP, S&amp;D, ECR, ALDE and ENF; supported by the EFDD group; with the
GUE/NGL abstaining.</p>
