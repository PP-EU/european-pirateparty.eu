         <h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
<p>We, the Undersigned, Convinced that, while remaining proud of their own
national identities and history, the peoples of Europe are determined to
transcend their former divisions and, united ever more closely, to forge a
common destiny, Based on the Uppsala and Prague Declarations, Aspiring to be
recognized as a Political Party at EU Level, Promoting the inviolable and
unalienable rights of the human being, freedom, democracy, equality and the
rule of law. Supporting the evolution of democracy on every level and assuring
transparency for political processes and decision-making, Focussing on the
long-term welfare of European citizens instead of big money, Emerging from the
struggle for a free, open and participative internet as a truly transnational
and international movement, Uniting the forces of Pirates and Pirate Parties
from all over Europe to influence European policy together, but with respect
for the autonomy of its members, Hoping to contribute to prosperity and peace
all over Europe, Subject to the ratification of the member parties, agree to
create an international non-profit association according to Luxembourgish law
and determine its statutes as follows:</p>
<h2>CONSTITUTION</h2>
<h2>General Provisions</h2>
<h4>Article 1 – Name</h4>
<p>(1) The official name of the association shall be “European Pirate Party” and
„European Pirates“, abbreviated “PPEU” or „PIRATES“. Both the full and the
abbreviated names may be used indistinguishably. (2) A list of official
translations of the association's name which may be used by the member parties
is included in Annex A.</p>
<h4>Article 2 – Seat</h4>
<p>(1) The seat of the European Pirate Party is situated at Luxembourg. (2) The
Board may move the seat anywhere in Luxembourg.</p>
<h4>Article 3 - Language</h4>
<p>(1) In the event of divergence or of doubt between these statutes in the
original version in English and any version in another language, the English
language version prevails. (2) English shall be the working language of the
Association. Any initiatives and proposals can only be adopted, if they have
been translated into English prior to the start of the decision-making-process
on the level of the Association.</p>
<h2>Aims and Goals</h2>
<h4>Article 4 – Principles</h4>
<p>(1) The Association shall pursue international aims in respect of the
principles on which the European Union is based, namely principles of freedom,
equality, solidarity, democracy, respect of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, and respect for the Rule of Law. (2) The Association shall work as
transparent as possible, regarding the protection of personal data and the
right to privacy of the people involved. (3) The Association shall take into
account the opinions of the individual Pirates who are members of any of the
member parties. Important decisions shall be based on democratic principles
for the inner workings of the Association. (4) The Association shall adhere to
all regulations necessary to being recognized as a Party at European level.
(5) The members of the Association shall adopt a common Pirate Manifesto
(Annex C) which shall reflect the principles and policies of the European
Pirate movement. (6) All decisions concerning choices and attitudes of PPEU
member parties or political organizations in their own countries remain
strictly under the sovereignty of national parties. (7) The Association may
carry out all operations and conduct all activities (including real estate
transactions), both in Belgium and abroad, which directly or indirectly
increase or promote its objectives under the condition that these activities
adhere to the principles of this organisation stated in this article. The
Association does not undertake industrial or commercial transactions and does
not seek to procure a profit to its members.</p>
<h4>Article 5 - Objectives</h4>
<p>(1) Purpose of the organisation is to represent the European Pirate movement
towards the European institutions and to work in the interest of its members
by, amongst other things:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>b) Assisting its members to promote the Pirate movement in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>c) Taking as its principles the Pirate manifesto, as will be annexed to the statutes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>d) Functioning as a link between European Pirate Parties and Pirate MEPs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>e) Encouraging and support its members in organizing events focused on European topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Members</h2>
<h4>Article 6 – Membership</h4>
<p>(1) The number of members is unlimited, but may not be less than five Ordinary
Members. All Members, except for natural persons, shall be legal entities
constituted according to the laws and customs of their country of origin. If a
member does not possess legal personality according to the laws and customs of
its country of origin, it must appoint a natural person to act in the name and
on behalf of its organisation and its members as a common attorney-in-fact. In
case of a change of representation, the <em>Board</em> of the association is
immediately informed in writing. (2) There are two categories of members:
Ordinary Members and Observer Members. (3) In Annex B to these Statutes all
the member parties and member organisations are listed. A register of all the
members will be kept at the registered office of the Association. This
register lists the surname, first name, place of residence, date and place of
birth of members or, in the case of legal persons or de facto associations,
the name, legal form, address of the registered office, identity of the
representative and, where applicable, the registration number in accordance
with existing legislation and/or regulations. The list shall be updated every
year by recording membership changes by name in alphabetical order. Any member
of the association may consult the list of members at the association’s
registered office free of charge. (4) Within one month of announcement of the
statutes, a list must be deposited with the registry of the civil court for
the place where the association is established, recording the name, legal
form, address of the registered office, identity of the representative and,
where applicable, the registration number in accordance with existing
legislation and/or regulations of all the Ordinary members of the association
in alphabetical order. The list shall be updated every year by recording
membership changes by name in alphabetical order.</p>
<h4>Article 7 – Ordinary Members</h4>

be repeated to change the membership status.</p>
<h4>Article 10 – Procedure for admitting new Members</h4>
<p>(1) To be eligible to become a Member of the Association, any aspiring party,
organisation or individual needs to send an application to the Board of the
Association to the address of the official seat. An email will suffice. (2)
The membership is granted, if the Council decides on it with a two-third
majority. The Council shall give reasons for accepting or rejecting
applications. As soon as the decision of the Council is valid and the new
member has paid its membership fee, it may exercise all its rights and is
bound to all obligations of its membership.</p>
<h4>Article 11 – Change of name and mergers</h4>
<p>(1) A Member that changes their name or merges with another political
party/organisation must inform the Board. (2) The Board shall assess the
degree of continuity of the new party/organisation with the Association's
member and will decide on the confirmation of the membership status. This
decision shall be confirmed by the Council. Both decisions require a two-third
majority. (3) In case of confirmation of the continuity of the membership
status; the member will be considered having accepted the Association's
decisions applicable to the former member and will be responsible for all it’s
obligations vis-à-vis the Association, including financial. (4) In case of
non-confirmation, the Council shall give reasons for the decision and the new
party/organisation may submit a new application for membership.</p>
<h4>Article 12 – Resignation, Exclusion, Suspension, Loss of Membership and</h4>
<p>Death / Dissolution / Bankruptcy</p>
<p>(1) Any member, whatever their identity, may at any time resign from the
Association. The resignation must be notified to the Board by registered
letter from a duly mandated person to the registered office of the
Association. The resignation shall come into effect immediately or as
otherwise specified in the letter of resignation, but the member resigning
remains bound by all outstanding debts contracted with the Association until
the end of the financial year in which the resignation came into effect. (2)
If a new Ordinary Member Party is superordinate to an existing Ordinary Member
Party, the subordinate party shall automatically become an Observer Member
Party. (3) Any member may also be suspended or excluded by the Council on at
least one of the following grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a) non-compliance with its obligations,</p>
</li>
<li><p>b) non compliance with the criteria for membership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(4) A suspended member is obliged to uphold its financial obligations to the
Association. The suspended member may attend meetings of the Association but
without voting rights. A suspended member can regain its membership if it
complies with its obligations and the criteria for membership. Such compliance
must be formally notified to the <em>Board</em> who then may recommend to the Council
to lift the suspension. (5) The exclusion of a member is also decided by the
Council. The exclusion comes into effect immediately after the decision of the
Council but the excluded member remains bound by all outstanding debts
contracted with the Association until the end of the financial year in which
the exclusion came into effect. (6) A proposal for suspension or expulsion of
a member may be submitted by any Ordinary Member or the Board, but not more
than once on the same grounds. All decisions on the suspension and exclusion
of a member are taken by a three-quarter majority. The concerned members may

or individuals on whose suspension or exclusion the Council will vote and the
grounds on which the proposed suspension or expulsion is based shall be named
in the agenda of the meeting and sent to all Council members with the
invitation to the next Council meeting. If this was not done, the non-
attending Council members shall be allowed to send their vote on the
suspensions and exclusions after the Council meeting. The concerned member
shall have the opportunity to plead its case during the Council meeting and
hand out a statement which shall be published with the minutes of the Council
meeting. The suspension or expulsion decision sets forth the grounds on which
the suspension or expulsion is based but apart from that, the decision does
not need to be justified, but it shall give reasons. A copy of the letter
shall be sent to the expelled member by registered letter, within 15 calendar
days. (7) A member’s affiliation ceases automatically upon death, dissolution,
disqualification, liquidation or in cases of temporary administration, court-

set annually by the Council on proposal of the Board represented by the
Treasurer. The Treasurer will meet up with all the Ordinary Member Parties'
Treasurers to discuss the obligations of the member parties in regard to the
annual fee in advance of the first Council meeting of the year. The Ordinary
Member Parties have to hand out to the Treasurer a copy of their last annual
account in advance of the meeting. If no agreement can be reached, the member
parties will pay the same fee as last year. Membership Fees are fixed in Euro;
they are payable without deduction of incurred costs. (2) The annual
Membership Fees of the Association's Ordinary Members consist of a basic fee
and an additional part based on decision of the Council. (3) The membership
fee will be multiplied by the number of additional and supplementary votes of
each Ordinary Member. (4) After the conditions listed in Art. 24 (Transitional
Clause) are fulfilled, the Association will make a new decision about the
details of determining the membership fees. (5) Observer Members do not have
to pay a fee. All members may further contribute by giving donations to the
Association. (6) Member parties who do not meet their financial commitments
will lose all voting and speaking rights within the organs and bodies of the
association as well as their right to propose candidates for positions within
the association, until they have paid off their arrears. A list outlining the
current Membership Fees’ situation will be distributed at each Council meeting
by the Treasurer. (7) Members must pay their annual contribution between the
first of January and the date of the annual Council meeting. On request of the
concerned Ordinary Member party the Council may allow them under special
circumstances with a 2/3-majority of the votes cast to delay their annual
contribution for up to one year or relieve them of the payment or a part of
it. The member party concerned may not vote on such a decision. (8) If a

Each Ordinary Member has a minimum entitlement of two delegates. (4) Ordinary
Members are entitled to 2 additional delegates if their total number of votes
is 4 or more, or to 4 additional delegates if their total number of votes is 8
or more. (5) For those sovereign states with more than one Ordinary Member in

<ul>
<li><p>a) Election results for regional parliaments are not used for the allocation system in the European Pirate Party.</p>
</li>
<li><p>b) The additional voting rights based on absolute numbers of votes as allocated under Paragraph 1 apply to each Ordinary Member.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>i) The highest national or European % election result of both Members are calculated together and that sum is used for the allocation system. The additional voting rights are distributed to the Ordinary Member with the highest % electoral result.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(6) Where Ordinary Members participate in an electoral alliance or coalition,
their votes will be calculated in proportion to the Pirate votes in the total
votes of the alliance/coalition based on the seats gained respectively by the
alliance and the Ordinary Member. (7) Adjustments to the number of delegates
and votes shall be made immediately following elections, whose results change
them. (8) The highest result reached in the last National or European
elections is used for calculating the number of votes and delegates. (9) In
addition to Ordinary Members, the Pirate Group in the European Parliament and
the YPE have the right to four delegates each and to 2 votes each. (10) Any
Ordinary member may also choose to use the lower result for the allocating of

supplementary votes deliberately which will also lower their membership fee.</p>

and the status of transactions to be reflected in the annual accounts shall be
entrusted to one or more auditors appointed by the Council from among the
members of the Luxembourgish Institute of Company Auditors (Institut des
réviseurs d'entreprises (IRE)). (2) The Council shall determine the number of
auditors and their remuneration. The auditors shall be appointed for a
renewable term of three years. The Council may revoke their mandates at any
time, but have to appoint new auditors at the same time. Any auditor appointed
to replace an auditor who has resigned in the course of his term of office
completes the latter’s term. (3) The auditors shall jointly or severally have
an unlimited right to scrutinise any transactions of the Association. They may
inspect on the premises the books, correspondence, minutes and generally any
documents of the association. (4) The accounts of the Association are to be
audited annually or as often as the law necessitates.</p>
<h2>Change of Statutes and the Pirate Manifesto and Decision-making-Process</h2>
<h4>Article 24 - Decision-making-Process</h4>
<p>(1) If not otherwise specified in these Statutes, all decisions taken by the
Council or the Board will be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast.
(2) All votes will be public and published in the minutes of a meeting,
including those for elections. They shall be done in writing, if appropriate.
Votes done in writing are usually appropriate for the election of members of
the Board. To fulfil the requirement of a written vote, an email or chat
protocol will be enough. Abstentions will not be taken into account.</p>
<h4>Article 25 – Change of Statutes</h4>
<p>(1) Proposals must be presented in writing by any means (electronic, paper or
otherwise) to the Board which will transmit them to the Members of the Council
for deliberation at least four weeks prior to the meeting at which the Council
will deliberate and decide on those proposals. The proposed amendments to the
Articles of Association must be attached to the notice calling the meeting of
the Council. A reference to a website displaying the proposed changes of the
Statutes would also be sufficient. (2) Decisions regarding amendments to the
Statutes can only be taken if there is an attendance quota of two-thirds of
the members entitled to vote present or represented and shall be taken with a
double majority of two-thirds of the votes cast by two-thirds of the Ordinary
Members taking part in the voting, except for decisions on the Principles
(Art. 4) and Objectives (Art. 5) where consent of all the Ordinary Council
Members is necessary. (3) Any decision amending the Statutes shall be
submitted to the Company Registrar (RCSL) and published according to the law.</p>
<h4>Art. 26 – Change of the Pirate Manifesto</h4>
<p>(1) The Pirate Manifesto combines the identified common policies of the member
parties in a document representing the common policies of the Association and
is an integral part of these Statutes. (2) Any changes to the Pirate Manifesto
will be following the same procedure as those to the Statutes.</p>
<h2>Duration and Dissolution</h2>
<h4>Article 27 – Duration and Dissolution</h4>
<p>(1) The Association shall be set up for an unlimited period of time. (2) The
Association is not dissolved as a result of the death, dissolution or
resignation of a member, provided the number of members is not less than five
Ordinary Members. (3) In the event that European legislation provides for a
different legal status for political parties and the Council of the
Association decides to adopt such a status, the financial and other assets of
the Association shall be transferred to the new legal entity upon the
cessation of the activities of the Association. (4) Except in the event of
judicial dissolution and automatic dissolution due to the requirements of the
law, the association may be prematurely dissolved only by a decision of the
Council acting in accordance with Article 20 of the Law on Not-for-profit
Associations. (5) It may be dissoluted by a four-fifth majority decision of
the Council with an attendance quota of two-thirds of the members entitled to
vote present or represented. If the quota is not reached, a new meeting of the
Council shall be called no earlier than 15 calendar days after the first
meeting. The second meeting of the Council shall be entitled to take valid
decisions irrespective of the number of members with voting rights present or
represented. (6) As from the moment the decision of dissolution is taken, the
Association is required to mention at all times that it is ‘in dissolution’.
(7) In the event that the Association is dissolved, the Council shall decide
by a simple majority of the votes cast on</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a) the appointment, powers and remuneration of the liquidators,</p>
</li>
<li><p>b) the methods and procedures for the liquidation of the Association and</p>
</li>
<li><p>c) the destination to be given to the net assets of the Association. The net assets of the Association will have to be allocated to a non-profit purpose. They may be divided among the member parties according to their financial contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(8) All such decisions have to be duly filed and published according to the
law.</p>
<h2>Transitional Provisions</h2>
<h4>Art. 28 – Transitional Clause</h4>
<p>(1) Within 6 months from the day when the PPEU is recognised by the EU as a
Political Party at the EU level an extraordinary convention shall convene to
revise all statutes and in particular to decide on new paragraphes regulating</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a) membership fee and</p>
</li>
<li><p>b) voting allocation for the Council.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) At the convention Ordinary Members will have the right to send delegates
with voting rights according to the current statutes regulating voting rights
in the Council. (3) If no agreement on a change can be reached, the current
regulation in the statutes will continue to apply.</p>
