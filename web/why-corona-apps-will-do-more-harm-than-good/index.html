<p>Even <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/are-we-any-
safer/492761/">after 9/11,</a> many surveillance measures were introduced, which were then
never reversed. Now that everyone is so focused on this crisis, it is
important to be vigilant that measures are not implemented under the motto
'never waste a good crisis' that give those in power more power, or restrict
our freedom. Particularly in times of crisis, it is important to take a
critical look at measures. The pandemic is a storm that is blowing over. The
choices we make now determine <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75">what kind of
world</a> we
wake up in when that storm blows over. In a democracy, it is better to focus
on good information than on repression. It is not possible to maintain
'physical distancing' everywhere and to check whether everyone washes their
hands enough. Most people make responsible choices on their own accord, when
it is properly explained why washing hands and 'one and a half metres' are so
important. The empty streets confirm this. However, there is also a focus on
technological repression, which generally does more harm than good. The
national Electronic Patient Dossier is still being <a href="https://www.nu.nl/tech/6043715/huisarts-kan-tijdelijk-zonder-toestemming-
bij-samenvatting-medisch-dossier.html">introduced
in</a> disguise (you can unsubscribe
<a href="https://www.volgjezorg.nl/inloggen-persoonlijke-omgeving">here</a>). <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1405921173/halsema-extra-camera-
s-amsterdam-om-coronacrisis">Camera
surveillance</a> is being extended, while we
<a href="https://sargasso.nl/dure-veiligheidsgevoelens/">know</a> that at best this only
leads to a temporary, limited improvement in the sense of security and only
displaces problems. <a href="https://www.nhnieuws.nl/nieuws/264542/drones-
gaan-dit-weekend-controleren-of-mensen-wel-voldoende-afstand-houden">Drones</a> snarl at
unsuspecting hikers that they have to keep a distance of one and a half
meters. This is reminiscent of a bad science fiction film. There is a risk
that we as a society will get used to this and <em>function creep</em> will occur:
technology that is first used for a certain purpose is later often used for
completely different things. I warned earlier about the risk that drones could
be used in the future to restrict the right to demonstrate or even to taser
people.</p>
<h3><strong>Corona apps</strong></h3>
<p>Recently the cabinet announced that it wants to deploy on two apps: (1) for
<em>'proximity tracing'</em> , to check whether you have been in the vicinity of an
infected person and (2) to estimate whether you have corona on the basis of
symptoms. When using technology, it is always important to first ask what
problem it actually solves. Both apps have the potential to provide more
insight into who may be infected. When we know better who may be infected and
therefore take extra precautions, this can in theory reduce the infection rate
(R0). If this happens successfully, current restrictive measures can be
released a little faster. So this could be good news for our freedom and the
economy. Enough reason, therefore, to investigate whether these apps can
actually make a serious contribution to this, without having to sacrifice
other fundamental rights such as privacy. What do other countries do? In
several countries 'tracing' apps have already been used. These were often
developed by <a href="https://www.mo.be/interview/veel-bedrijven-achter-
corona-apps-werkten-samen-met-inlichtingendiensten">companies</a> that had previously done
business with secret services. In <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-
news/.premium-israeli-coronavirus-surveillance-who-s-tracking-you-and-what-
happens-with-the-data-1.8685383">Israel</a> and China there is totalitarian surveillance
that would be totally unacceptable in the Netherlands. Without the right
'<a href="https://twitter.com/Matthijs85/status/1243497164493463552">health code</a>',
access is also denied in many places. The app in South Korea is also a
<a href="https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/item/in-zuid-korea-worden-
corona-apps-volop-gebruikt-maar-vooral-de-testcapaciteit-zorgt-er-voor-
control/">privacy disaster</a>. In <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/aplikacja-
kwarantanna-domowa--ruszyl-proces-jej-udostepniania">Poland</a> and
<a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/aplikacja-kwarantanna-domowa--
ruszyl-proces-jej-udostepniania">India</a>, you have to send a selfie every hour(!) to
prove that you are good at home isolation. In the EU, we should at least
require that participation in the app is completely voluntary, so there are no
restrictions if you don't want to or can't install the app, for example
because you don't own a smartphone. This is relatively often the case among
(vulnerable) elderly people in particular. It is not yet possible to say
whether this technology has made a serious contribution to controlling corona.
In South Korea the situation seems reasonably under control, but because of
the collectivist culture and experience with the SARS epidemic, other cultural
and social standards apply as well in terms of <a href="https://vitals.lifehacker.com/were-calling-it-physical-distancing-

distancing</a> and wearing <a href="https://twitter.com/Matthijs85/status/1247220894260486144">mouth
masks</a>. The apps
seem to have played only a

role</a> and
<a href="https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/item/in-zuid-korea-worden-
corona-apps-volop-gebruikt-maar-vooral-de-testcapaciteit-zorgt-er-voor-

deployment of an app has totally
<a href="https://twitter.com/brenno/status/1247590211816742912">failed</a>. Because of
the cooperation with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-google-
partner-on-coronavirus-contact-tracing-technology-11586540203">Google</a> and the lack of
transparency, hardly anyone wanted to install the app.</p>
<h3><strong>What will the Netherlands use?</strong></h3>
<p>Storage of location data in a central database should be avoided. Professor
A.I. and Privacy <a href="https://nporadio1.nl/binnenland/22893-volg-apps-tegen-corona-
levensgevaarlijk-om-overheden-data-te-laten-verzamelen">Rob van Hoven van
Genderen</a> rightly states that it
is life threatening if the government obtains access to our location data via
a corona app. Even if it is claimed that the data has been made anonymous,
linking it to other data would make it possible to <a href="https://themarkup.org/ask-the-markup/2020/03/24/when-is-anonymous-not-
really-anonymous">trace
the</a> data back to a person. Such a database would be a <a href="https://twitter.com/brenno/status/1247572679848267779">potential
gold mine</a>. Who's going
to secure it? Government<a href="https://www.binnenlandsbestuur.nl/digitaal/nieuws/meldingen-datalekken-
bij-overheid-verdrievoudigd.9607033.lynkx"> data
leaks</a> are commonplace. Hugo de Jonge
leaves a lot <a href="https://twitter.com/brenno/status/1247573845474709505">unclear</a>.
This seems to be due to a lack of expertise. Feike Sijbesma states that the
use of apps from <a href="https://www.parool.nl/nederland/kabinet-wil-apps-
gebruiken-in-strijd-tegen-corona-privacy-moet-gewaarborgd~bb8334ba/">Asian</a> suppliers
is still being considered. This seems to be mainly about TraceTogether from
<a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">Singapore</a>. Hugo de Jonge also mentions
Germany and Great Britain. Behind the scenes, the European consortium <a href="https://www.pepp-pt.org/">PEPP-PT
is</a> working on an app. TraceTogether works on
<em>contact tracing</em> via bluetooth. The app keeps track of your encounters, and
when you've been within two meters of someone, you get a warning and can go
into strict home isolation. It just didn't work well on iPhones. <a href="https://twitter.com/Nieuwsuur/status/1247615350650417157">Marcel
Roorda</a> described a
similar plan at Nieuwsuur. The problem with this, however, is that this data
is stored centrally. Participants within PEPP-PT also seem to rely on central
storage. Huib Modderkolk already stated that Germany and Great Britain will
probably work with <a href="https://twitter.com/dit_is_M/status/1247939315876990976/video/1">central data
storage</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Could it be more privacy friendly?</strong></h3>
<p>An app becomes more privacy friendly if the contact moments are stored
<a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/07/een-corona-app-als-het-al-werkt-
dan-decentraal-graag/">decentrally</a>: only on both phones. A group of European scientists is
working on such a system, under the name <a href="https://github.com/DP-3T">DP3-T</a>.
<a href="https://waag.org/nl/article/tracking-en-tracing-tijden-van-corona">De Waag</a>
clearly describes how this works: <em>"When the owner of phone A is now found to
be positive (by a healthcare professional, and only then), the app registers
this in a central place by publishing the 'decryption key' of the app on A.
With this key, anyone using the application can check whether they have been
in contact with the person who published this key (this happens automatically,
in the background) and take appropriate measures".</em> But with decentralized
storage and complete voluntariness we are not there yet.
<a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements">CCC</a> and
<a href="https://www.veiligtegencorona.nl/">Bits of Freedom</a> have both drawn up a nice
list of 10 requirements, which include efficiency, temporariness,
transparency, open source, security and user-friendliness. Even when all these
requirements are met, the app can still count on privacy concerns. For
security reasons, the government itself always
<a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2019/mei/01/beveiligingsrichtlijnen-
voor-mobiele-apparaten/Beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-mobiele-apparaten-
deel-1.pdf">advises</a> you to turn off your WiFi and bluetooth before you leave home. If
you always have to have your bluetooth on because of a corona app, this is of
course <a href="https://twitter.com/LotNote/status/1247809383846670338">not</a> possible.</p>
<h3><strong>Is the Cabinet going to meet those conditions?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.evajinek.nl/video/fragmenten/video/5084551/kabinet-wil-
tracing-apps-als-kern-van-het-nieuwe-testbeleid">Feike
Sijbesma</a>, <a href="https://www.computable.nl/artikel/nieuws/zorg/6910520/250449/kabinet-
wil-desnoods-verplichte-app-bij-coronatesten.html">Hugo de Jonge and Mark
Rutte</a> seem to have little
confidence that many people want to install the app. Feike Sijbesma mentions
that an app in which only 15% of the population participates is useless.
That's why they keep the possibility open to make the app
<a href="https://www.evajinek.nl/video/fragmenten/video/5084551/kabinet-
wil-tracing-apps-als-kern-van-het-nieuwe-testbeleid">mandatory</a>. They also mention the
possibility that, just like in
<a href="https://twitter.com/Matthijs85/status/1243497164493463552">China</a>, people
can't access 'certain establishments' without the app. How do they want to
control and enforce that? About 50% of people over 75 do
<a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2020/04/15/deze-crisis-vraagt-om-een-visie-
voor-iedereen-in-plaats-van-een-app-voor-alles/">not</a> have <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2020/04/15/deze-crisis-vraagt-om-een-
visie-voor-iedereen-in-plaats-van-een-app-voor-alles/">a
smartphone</a>. Would they want to
give a present to everyone who doesn't have a smartphone? An obligation is not
only totally unacceptable, but also impractical. Just before Easter, a tender
for the app was opened, which was closed immediately after the Easter weekend.
This tender did not meet the normal requirements, not even with an abridged
procedure. A number of essential substantive requirements (e.g. open source,
decentralised storage) were <a href="https://www.tenderned.nl/tenderned-
tap/aankondigingen/192421;section=2">not even
mentioned</a>. This creates little confidence.</p>
<h3><strong>Does it solve anything?</strong></h3>
<p>Among other things, Bits of Freedom states that an app should never be
introduced unless it is proven to work. Something that is<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/governments-havent-shown-location-
surveillance-would-help-contain-covid-19"> not yet the
case</a>. But could something like that work?
<a href="http://allai.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brief-Minister-
President-Rutte-Ministers-De-Jonge-Van-Rijn-Grapperhaus-de-heer-Sijbesma-
inzake-COVID-19-tracking-en-tracing-en-gezondheidsapps.pdf">There's no</a> chance of that. If
you've been within two meters, but this person hasn't talked to you, the
chances of you being infected are <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5084431/corona-tracking-apps-
overheid-hoe-werkt-het">very
slim</a>. Especially if there was a window or wall in between.
So there will be a <a href="https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/meer-dan-zestig-
wetenschappers-sturen-samen-brandbrief-aan-kabinet-over-corona-app~a44c5e2d/">lot of</a>
<em>false positives</em> : people who receive a false warning. On the other hand, the
app doesn't recognize it if you touch a door handle that was touched by a
corona patient a minute earlier. Even with an app, you
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/most-workplaces-to-
close-schools-will-move-to-full-home-based-learning-from-next">cannot</a> prevent all
infections. For good contact tracing you still need
<a href="http://smh.com.au/national/contact-tracing-how-disease-detectives-
are-closing-in-on-covid-19-in-australia-20200410-p54itv.html">people</a>; no apps. This
makes the question of what to do with all warnings even more important. Test
capacity is limited. Even after the increase, the capacity is only 40,000 per
day. This means that it still takes almost a month to test all healthcare
personnel. That's not to mention people who are labelled as potentially
infected by proximity tracing. <a href="https://twitter.com/Jinek_RTL/status/1247980925897629703">How
many</a> people will go
into strict home isolation, or want to use the app at all, if the chances of
actually being infected are so small and they can't even get <a href="https://www.spaink.net/2020/04/15/zonder-testen-geen-nut/">tested
in</a> case of a
warning? The 'OLVG-hospital app', where you enter your symptoms to see if you
may have corona, also offers a limited solution. In Iceland, where many people
were tested, it turned out that
<a href="https://twitter.com/Matthijs85/status/1246763825300475909">half</a> of the
people tested positive had no symptoms at all. These people will therefore not
be recognized by the app anyway. <a href="https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/meer-dan-zestig-wetenschappers-
sturen-samen-brandbrief-aan-kabinet-over-corona-app~a44c5e2d/">More than 60
scientists</a> rightly point
out that an app with such limited reliability can lead to additional
infections. In order to control corona, it is important to test massively to
check who is infected, to isolate these persons temporarily and to
<a href="https://piratenpartij.nl/corona-tracking-waarschuwings-apps-
bescherming-is-de-sleutel-niet-het-volgen/">protect</a> vulnerable persons well. Due to
the poor reliability of the announced apps, many will become unnecessarily
anxious while giving others a false sense of security. Let's not sacrifice
Fundamental Rights for this sham solution!</p>
