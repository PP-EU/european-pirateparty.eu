        <b><h2>Pirate MEP Marcel Kolaja</h2>
</b>

         <p>:</p>
<p>As part of the gradual lifting of confinement measures, the Commission
published on April 16 an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf">EU
toolbox</a>,
developed by Member States for the use of mobile applications for contact
tracing and warning in response to the spreading of COVID-19. This is a very
timely and welcome initiative given that certain countries started to work on
their own measures, often declaring state of emergency and deprioritizing
fundamental rights.<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-
coronavirus-app-offers-playbook-for-other-governments/">Poland</a> was one of the first
Western countries to roll out an app that collects large amount of personal
data, including people’s location and digital photos, in order to combat the
pandemic.</p>
<h3>Measures in Member States</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/nieuws/gebruik-telecomdata-
tegen-corona-alleen-met-wet">information shared by Member
States</a>, more than half of EU countries have tapped
telecom companies data to monitor citizens’ movements under confinement
measures. Even though data protection authorities in certain countries already
stated that it’s not possible to anonymize telecom location data.

measures-en.png" alt=""> Country | Measures<br>
---|---<br>
<strong>Austria</strong> | Austrian telecom operator A1,
<a href="https://newsroom.a1.net/news-stellungnahme-zur-aktuellen-
medienberichterstattung?id=103337&amp;menueid=12658&amp;l=deutsch">confirmed</a> that they made
analyses on aggregate movement of people available to government agencies.<br>
<strong>Belgium</strong> | <em>Data Against Corona Taskforce</em> established by the Ministers for
Health and Digital Agenda. Task is to analyze anonymized data from telecom
companies to assess the spread of the virus and identify high risk areas.<br>
<strong>Bulgaria</strong> | A
<a href="https://dv.parliament.bg/DVWeb/showMaterialDV.jsp?idMat=147150">law</a> has been
recently adopted on measures and actions to be taken during the emergency. It
amends the Communications Act to allow police to request telephone and
Internet operators’ data on people placed under compulsory quarantine, in
order to monitor their movements, trace contacts, and enforce quarantine
measures. Internet operators are obliged to retain user data for six months
and to forward it to the police upon request.<br>
<strong>Croatia</strong> | A <a href="https://www.sabor.hr/prijedlog-zakona-o-
dopunama-zakona-o-elektronickim-komunikacijama-s-konacnim-prijedlogom-
zakona?t=115803&amp;tid=208662">proposal to amend</a> the Electronic Communications Act was recently
debated by the Parliament. It aims at making it easier for authorities to
access the location data of people who are under prescribed self-isolation.<br>
<strong>Czechia</strong> | Plans are underway to launch a <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/prague-smart-
quarantine/"><em>smart quarantine</em>
system</a> to track the movements of persons who have been tested positive.
The system shall require such persons to consent to share data from their
mobile phones and payment cards in order to track contacts.<br>
<strong>Cyprus</strong> | According to local news, the Health Minister was preparing new
measures to combat COVID-19 that might include monitoring electronically
infected people via a wristband or possibly an <a href="https://www.thecyprusnow.com/cyprus-coronavirus-ankle-bracelet-gps-
tracker-like-criminals/">ankle
bracelet</a>.<br>
<strong>France</strong> | Mobile operator Orange confirmed that they have started sharing
aggregate and anonymized <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/telco-metadata-grab-is-for-modelling-
covid-19-spread-not-tracking-citizens-says-ec/">geolocation
data</a> with Inserm, a public research
institute. The country has not taken yet any concrete initiative on location
tracking, but is considering a <a href="https://www.la-
croix.com/France/Donnees-geolocalisation-contre-coronavirus-debat-couve-
France-2020-03-25-1301086081">strategy</a> for the digital identification of people who
have been in contact with infected persons.<br>
<strong>Germany</strong> | Deutsche Telekom
<a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article206624141/Coronavirus-
Telekom-teilt-Bewegungsstroeme-von-Handynutzern-mit-RKI.html">announced</a> publicly that it
was sharing anonymized location data of its users with the <em>Robert-Koch
Institute</em> , a research institute and government agency responsible for
disease control and prevention. The country is currently exploring introducing
an app for tracking new infections and tracing contacts.<br>
<strong>Ireland</strong> | Is preparing the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/coronavirus-
smartphone-app-to-facilitate-contact-tracing-to-be-rolled-out-hse-

<strong>Poland</strong> | The Polish Ministry of Digitization released an app called <em>Home
quarantine</em> to help ensure that people observe quarantine measures. Accounts
are automatically created for all those in quarantine. Users are requested to
periodically send geo-located selfies to prove they are at home. If they fail
to comply, the police is alerted. The data shall be retained for 6 years.<br>
<strong>Slovakia</strong> | The <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/short_news/bratislava-parliament-
approves-tracking-people-infected-with-covid-19/"><em>corona
bill</em></a> adopted on March 25 allows
the Public Health Office to use data from telecom operators to track the
movements of persons infected with COVID-19, and of those in compulsory
quarantine, based on their consent. Police and secret services have access to
this data and may be able to identify a person after obtaining a court order.<br>
<strong>Slovenia</strong> | A law was proposed that would allow the police to monitor the
location of individuals who opt for self-isolation instead of mandatory
quarantine. Due to strong criticism, the law was adopted without the
controversial provisions.<br>
<strong>Spain</strong> | Use of mobile phone location data is planned to <a href="https://www.thelocal.es/20200402/spain-plans-to-use-mobile-phone-
data-to-track-citizens-during-coronavirus-crisis">track people’s
movements</a> in order to assess adherence
to lockdown measures. It is reported that the Ministry of Health also intends
to use location data to launch an app which shall alert users to carry out a
self-assessment. Tracking apps have already been released in
<a href="http://canalsalut.gencat.cat/ca/salut-

<h3>Recommendations in the toolbox</h3>
<p>Although it is possible to agree with the basic outline of these
recommendations, the devil is in the detail as usual. I would also have liked
to see a more ambitious proposal from the Commission, with proper enforcement,
instead of recommendation. Nevertheless, the four essential requirements for
tracing apps laid out in the toolbox are on spot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voluntary:</strong> Making the use of apps voluntary is important, as it would ensure that applications are used only with the consent of users, in line with current data protection laws. At the same time, the scope of these recommendations shouldn’t be limited to voluntary apps only (see the example of Poland above).</li>
<li><strong>Approved by the national health authority:</strong> It is also important that the applications have to be approved by the national health authority, as the most important task of such applications is to serve the purpose of tracing infection transmission chains inside the country and across borders. This would also ensure that the contact tracing app is used only for public health purposes and not for political ones.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy-preserving—personal data is securely encrypted:</strong> This is an absolute requirement for any app. Medical data is sensitive data even in the physical world protected under special conditions. However, additional safeguards such as decentralized data storage would be welcome.</li>
<li><strong>Dismantled as soons as no longer needed</strong> : Time limit on use is something I have been advocating for as this can ensure that interference with fundamental rights remains temporary. It’s unfortunate though that the recommendation doesn’t set any specific time limit, only mentions that it should be dismantled as soon as no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In addition to these pillars, I see the following as key points:</strong> The
toolbox is not limited to contact tracing and warning functionality. Member
States will consider further use such as symptom tracking. It is important to
make users aware of such features from the beginning and empower them to
consent to these uses. The toolbox also elaborates on how to prevent
proliferation of harmful apps: app stores will have to cooperate and delist
harmful applications and promote government apps. Thus, they will have to
monitor their own service to see which one is the official application and
which one isn’t. This shouldn’t become the backdoor to any future rules on
platforms that would impose general monitoring obligation. The use of Open
Source is explicitly recommended by the Commission in order to support
transparency and interoperability. This is a very important requirement that
for instance can help the verification whether the functioning is in line with
data protection rules. Unfortunately, the Commission’s own hackathon taking
place this weekend encourages the use of proprietary software, which
contradicts this initiative. Jointly with 33 Members of the European
Parliament, we
<a href="https://mastodon.pirati.cz/@marcel_kolaja/104046342896480448">urged</a> the
Commission to change this. While the toolbox is a useful tool, it is silent on
certain unclear provisions in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_-
_a_european_roadmap_to_lifting_coronavirus_containment_measures_0.pdf">Commission’s Joint European Roadmap towards
lifting COVID-19 containment
measures</a>, such
as <em>participatory surveillance</em> , which is meant to complement information
gathered by the authorities with data on search history and interaction on
social media. A really inaccurate and unnecessary data which shouldn’t be used
for purposes of tackling COVID-19.</p>
